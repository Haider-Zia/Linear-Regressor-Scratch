The assignment needs to be run in this order:
1) DataGeneration.py to generate the data and save it in a csv file
2)LinearRegression.py to reach a value of m and c using linear regression, save them in a csv file, and plot that line against the initially generated data
3)TrainedPredictor.py to take user input of an x value and predict a corresponding y value

NOTE: Eventhough I think the program is written correctly in accordance to the notes I took of the algorithm, the values of m and c reached by the program are extreme and wildly inaccurate. As a result, the plotting looks weird. On the top left corner of the plotting, you can see something like "lel8" written, indicating some exponential power. In comparison, the plotted actual data points look weird too. There may be an error I cannot find, or there may be some issue with alpha and h. I do not know.
